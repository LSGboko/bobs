The Congress held in Gboko,          Benue State, Nigeria with participants from all across our          nation and a few from outside.           The  opening  charge  came  with  a  strong  call  to  battle          with the title: “Battle  for  the  Young”. Several aspects of          the  meeting  focused  on  what  young  people  like  you          must do, the battle you must win, the choices you must          make, the yoke you must bear and the vision you must          contract, ‘now that you are young’.          The  issue of  the  choice of  a  marriage partner,  who  will          also be  a  life-partner  with  you in  life  and  in  all of  your          endeavours  for  the  rest  of  your  life,  came  with  such  a          strong emphasis. Thousands bought the video tapes, the          mp3  messages  and  even  now  the  messages  are  still          running on radio and on several online media channels.          We thought it was enough to leave it at that until God          confronted us again about the fact that this battle for the          young is very fierce and it will continue to be intensive.          We  must  therefore  engage  every  means  and  every          platform to fight it and make sure that you win this battle          while you are young and before the evil day comes.","Page 10               finding the          Many who would have been great in this life and for the         kingdom of God were crippled and became a shadow of         what they could have been because they were caught in         the web of wrong choices in marriage. Others started as         if they have escaped the trap, only to later plunge their         matrimony  into  the  mud  due  to  lack  of  knowledge  of         what to do.         Several  children  are  born  out  of  wedlock  and  so  are         faced  with  the  trauma  of  being  ‘single  parented’,  all         because of this omission of their mother or father at the         time  they  were  young.  Unfortunately,  many  young         people have no idea of what a correct marriage should         look  like,  as  they  have  never  seen  one  that  actually         worked.         All of these built up the burden in our hearts  to get  to         work  again  on  another  book  that  will  provide  a  simple         but practical biblical guide for the choice of a life partner,         now that you are young.                          “Knowing how  to  charm  a snake  is  of  no  use  if            you let the snake bite first.”                                       Ecclesiastes 10:11 GNB         This  scripture  shows  the  urgency  of  this  book  in  your         hands.

Several          hands were engaged right from the initial transcribing of          the message from audio by Ruth Oyunwola.          My wife, Sade laboured on the transposing of the script          from spoken English to this present form and edited it to          the point I was asked to bring in some more input.

They  begin  to  consciously  dress  and          arrange their appearance to become presentable, so they          can be admired by the opposite sex. Whether they begin          to actively seek relationship with the opposite sex or not,          the awareness is real and their interest stimulated.           Towards the end of this stage of youthful development          this  awareness  translates  into  an  attraction  for  certain          individuals that they become acquainted with.  If a young          man/woman is however not guided at this juncture, the          result is a misuse of this natural divine attraction and it          may result in a damage to their future career and home.                   God  Himself  is  the  one  who  arranged  this  segment  of          choice-making and planted in you the interest in making          a choice of whom to spend the rest of your life with.          Meanwhile, choices that affect one’s destiny throughout          life  and  particularly  at old  age  are  made  in  the  days  of          one’s  youth.  But  of  most  importance  it  is  to  note  that          choices  made  at  this  stage  are  almost  completely          irreversible; and damages incurred at this point are also","Page 16               finding the         often irredeemable.                  Since marriage is not a temporary estate into which you         can  enter  and come out at  will  without  any damage  to         your  life,  it  then  becomes  necessary  to  seek  proper         guidance from God who made you and can see the end         from  the  beginning,  before  you  make  the  choice  of  a         marriage partner.          The Irreversible Marriage Choice           here are some things that you can easily change and           r         T etrace your steps from, if you choose wrongly. One of         such  things  is  career.  I  do  know  someone,  who  was  a         brilliant medical student when we were in the university.          He  graduated  as  a  medical  doctor  and  went  as  far  as         becoming  a  consultant.  But  now,  he  has  become  a         photographer, as he realized that his passion was rather         in  photography.  The  truth  is  that  even  though  making         the right choice of a career is very important at a tender         age,  if  you  miss  the  right  choice  of  a  career,  you  most          often can always change it.                 I  have  met  people  who  now  speak  very  lightly  about","1 — You need God’s guidance              Page 17           marriage, as if it were a pair of shoes or clothes that you          can choose to wear today and tomorrow you can change          your  mind  and  wear  another  pair  depending  on  your          mood;  as  if  you  can  pick  and  drop  your  choice  in          marriage as you like.          Such people  are  wicked  and  insincere.  They  are people          who probably have failed in their marriages and are now          looking  for  some  others  to  join  them  in  their          predicament.          They  try  to  trivialize  the  weighty  matter  of  a  life-long          relationship in marriage because of their own mistakes at          the point of choice. Their lives are already damaged and          they are only looking for people to company with. I pray          that God will help you avoid joining their company.          There is no one who has a good marriage and is enjoying          his  marriage  that  will  encourage  you  on  the  path  of          divorce. Anyone who makes a wrong choice at the point          of marriage has acquired a permanent problem for life.          You need to pay attention to God’s instructions so that          you can make a proper and appropriate choice when the          time  comes.  Since  God  originated  and  instituted          marriage, it is necessary to take the utmost care and get          proper guidance from Him before making a choice.           Marriage is Of Tomorrow          A brother or sister who looks zealous today may not be          so tomorrow. So, you cannot even depend on what you          see in a man or woman today to make a choice.           There  was  a  brother  who  was  the  president  of  the          Christian  Union  in  one  of  the  biggest  universities  in","Page 18               finding the          Nigeria.  He  was  a  spirit-filled,  ‘tongue-talking’  brother.         For  you  to  be  the  President  of  such  a  group  in  such  a         university in our days, you must have been a very serious         Christian. There was also this beloved sister; a very sound         Christian sister in those days. They both later got married         and lived together for some years.          One day, several years later, I was invited to preach in the         city  where  they  lived.  Then  I  met  the  sister.  After         exchanging  few  pleasantries,  she  looked  me  straight  in         the eyes and said . . .              Though  I  was  tired  from  a  long  journey  and  meetings         which ended late in the evening, she insisted it is urgent         that I meet with her husband. So I went with my wife.         This  man  was  a  brilliant  architect;  they  were  living  in  a         beautiful  five-bedroom  house.  When  we  got  in  there,         because  of  their  marriage  that  had  now  started  to         scatter, the brother built a wall of partition to cut off two         rooms for his wife to live in.         And  he  kept  the  sitting  room,  the  kitchen  and  every         good part of the house on his side of the building. There         was  electricity  on  his  side  but  there  was  none  on  the         wife’s side. That was the situation we met them in.","1 — You need God’s guidance              Page 19           You need to seek proper guidance from the Lord before          you  pick  any  man  or  woman  in  marriage.  Marriage  for          you as of now, is not in the present; it is in the future; and          you do not  know  that  future. You do not know  what it          will be.           You Are Not Marrying The Anointing          Do not marry a man just because he is a preacher. When          a  man gets  on  the  pulpit,  he becomes  another  man  as          the Spirit of God uses him mightily. It may not even be          because of his power or holiness of life that made God          decide to use him powerfully; it may simply be in answer          to the cry of the congregation for God to speak to them.          So  you  must  not  rush  to  marry  a  man  because  of  the          anointing of the Holy Spirit flowing through him on the          altar.                     So if all you see that makes you agree to marry a man is          his  ‘performance  on  stage’,  it  may  amount  to          presumption.  It  means  you  are  merely  marrying  a          performance and that may not make the marriage last.          Some people are great on the pulpit, but their homes are          in shambles. I once met a dear brother whom I knew very          well in the past, in a meeting. He lived in that town with          his wife. He was a very gentle brother when we were on          the  campus.  By  the  time  we  were  meeting,  he  had","Page 20               finding the          already become a lecturer. It was surprising that he had         started having great conflicts with his wife to the extent         of physically beating her.         I  could  have  vouched  for  him  that  something  like  that         could never happen because he was a very gentle man of         God. But you need to know that the gentility you see in a         brother when he is not married is untested gentility. But         if,  when he  is  married,  he  is still  gentle,  that is gentility         indeed. It was terrible for me to discover the kind of fight         that they were having.                 I  went  to  another  place  where  a  friend  invited  me  to         preach and I was lodged in his house. His wife was also a         very wonderful Christian sister that I knew before. But in         the  midst  of  our  going  in  and  out  to  preach,  she         whispered to me, “Brother Gbile, I will like to talk to you.”         I was surprised that she had to whisper that, even in the         absence of her husband.         When I got talking with her, she said, “He will not let me         talk to you, if I let him know; but I am dying inside”. All         these  activities  that  you  see  him  doing,  as  if  all  is  well,         they are not real. We have troubles.” When she began to         talk to me, I shivered.  She said to me,","1 — You need God’s guidance              Page 21             I  spoke  with  her  and  promised  to  send  her  some          recorded  Christian  messages.  But  within  three  months,          she  died.  If  the  foundation  be  shaken,  what  can  the          righteous do?           Marriage Is Not About Infatuation          It  is  also  not  every  good  looking  Christian  sister  today          that carries a tangible destiny for your life. It is not every          lady with robust cheeks that can run with you for life. If          you  marry  a singing  girl  because she sings, how  would          you know if she is also a stinger?          When she begins to sting your life, you will then begin to          sing new songs of regret.          None  of  these  marriages  that  hit  the  rock  started  in  a          bad way. There was an intoxication of so-called love and          affection  at  the  beginning.  There  was  a  superlative          promise  and  overwhelming  tenderness  and  pampering          that every man usually puts forth at the beginning.           There is the softness of touch and embrace that comes          with the first love and take-off points in many marriages.          But when the “wine” begins to finish, and the love begins          to fade out, the soup is no longer sweet. The darling of          yesterday has become the dagger of today. Look at how          the word of God expressed the issue . . .             “And  he  said  to  him,  “Every  man  at  the             beginning sets out the good wine, and when the             guests  have  well  drunk,  then  the  inferior.  You             have kept the good wine until now!””                                             John 2:10 NKJV          This is what every natural man or woman does. No one","Page 22               finding the          will step on your toes or slap you when he is still seeking         your hand in marriage. He will bring forth the best wine         until you are caught and well drunk with infatuation; then         he will bring forth that which is worse.          Unless  Jesus  is  brought  in  at  the  very  onset  and  He  is         kept at the center of your matrimony, the eventual thing         is  the  setting  in  of  the  law  of  diminishing  returns.  You         need  guidance  from  Him  who  can  always  turn  the         present watery love into a fresh wine of love to keep your         marriage fresh and fulfilling.         This  choice is  a bridge between  your  today  as  a young         person and your future. You may not likely become the         heir, king and priest that God wants you to be (Rev. 1:6) if         your marital life is damaged by means of a wrong choice.         The  choice  you  make  today  will  determine  all  the         chances  you  will  have  tomorrow  to  become  what  you         were born to become for your generation.          Whereas the promise of your ministry or career may be         great before the Lord, you may even be setting the stage         well to accomplish it, yet, the state of your marital life will         eventually  determine  the  outcome  of  your  success  or         failure in life.              You need God at this time of setting the foundation of         your  marital  life.  You  need  God  to  help  you  make  the         right  choice.  You  need  God  to  ensure  that  your  home         does not become the pit that will swallow whatever else         you become in life.","1 — You need God’s guidance              Page 23","Page 24","finding the bone of your bones                              2 — BUT NOT LIKE                                   THE MULE . . .                od has made a promise . . .

The plans          He has for you is for good and not for disaster.           He  is  very  interested  and  personally  concerned  about          your choices in life, so He has offered to guide you along          the  best  pathway  for  your  life.  He  wants  to  simply          instruct and teach you the way you should go. If you also          simply obey, your path will be smooth in life.","Page 26               finding the          That promise is our first basis of assurance that we can         make the right choices in life . . . including the choice of         who to marry.         God  promises  to  instruct  you;  He  who  knows  the  way         through the wilderness, the valleys and the mountains on         the  path  of  life.  He  wants  to  watch  your  progress  and         direct you to the best of His provisions in life.         But you must not be senseless; you must not be without         understanding. You must not be one who will not obey         until he experiences something painful. Inflicting pain is         the  only  way  to  guide  brute  beasts.  They  are  senseless         and without understanding, so they cannot be reasoned         with. The only way to get across to them is by whips and         bits. You must not be like that.                    What could make you like a horse or a mule in life? What         is  that  thing that  makes it  difficult  for  you to hear God         and  walk  in  line  with  His  will  for  your  life?  What  is  the         arrogance  within  your  breast  that  puffs  you  up  to  leap         before you see the pit? The only answer I can find for it is         what the word of God refers to as “the carnal man or the         natural heart”.         Since it is so crucial, I will quickly highlight it so that you         can take your journey into life with the ease of divine help.","2 — but not like the Mule . . .

For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the             deep  things  of  God.  For  what  man  knows  the             things  of  a  man  except  the  spirit  of  the  man             which is in him? Even so no one knows the things             of God except the Spirit of God.”                                     1Corinthians 2:9-11 NKJV          This is the first critical issue here. Eye has not seen, nor          ear heard, and it has not entered the heart of any man,          the things  which He has prepared particularly for those          who love Him.          What  God  has  kept  in  store  for  you  and  what  He  is          preparing you for, is a top secret in His heart. The way to          lead you into it is also in His secret file. No one has the          code for it. This is the first thing I wish to impress on you.           Look at how the Amplified version puts it in 1Cor. 2: 9-11.              “But,  on  the  contrary,  as  the  Scripture  says,             What  eye  has  not  seen  and  ear  has  not  heard             and has not entered into the heart of man, [all             that] God has prepared (made and keeps ready)             for  those  who  love  Him  [who  hold  Him  in             affectionate  reverence,  promptly  obeying  Him             and  gratefully  recognizing  the  benefits  He  has             bestowed].

Just  so  no  one            discerns  (comes  to  know  and  comprehend)  the            thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.                                           1Cor. 2:9-11 AMP         But  God  has  decided  to  unveil  and  reveal  it  to  you  by         and  through  His  Spirit.  Even  for  the  Holy  Spirit  to         discover it and make it clear and explicit to you, He has         to search diligently, exploring and examining everything.         He even goes to the extent of sounding (like a geologist)         the profound and bottomless things of God.         These  are  the divine  counsels  and  things hidden in  the         heart  of  God  for  you.  It is beyond  man’s scrutiny.  They         are not on the surface neither are they superficial. This is         why  it  would  be  a  great  presumption  and  omission  to         just latch on any girl because of what you see of her face         or her figure.          Have  you  sought  to  know  the  bottomless  and  hidden         things that God has kept in store for your marriage? It is         not  just  marching  to  the  altar,  wearing  the  wedding         gown that makes an enduring marriage.

Only those who possess the          Holy  Spirit  can  actually  comprehend,  hear  and          understand these truths. They are not set forth in words          taught by human wisdom but words taught by the Holy          Spirit.             But the natural man does not receive the things             of  the  Spirit  of  God,  for  they  are  foolishness  to             him;  nor  can  he  know  them,  because  they  are             spiritually discerned.                                                  1Cor. 2:14             But  the  natural,  nonspiritual  man  does  not             accept  or  welcome  or  admit  into  his  heart  the             gifts and  teachings and  revelations of  the  Spirit             of God, for they are folly (meaningless nonsense)             to him; and he is incapable of knowing them [of             progressively  recognizing,  understanding,  and             becoming  better  acquainted  with  them]  because             they are spiritually discerned and estimated and             appreciated.                                             1Cor. 2:14 AMP          This  is  what  makes  someone  a  mule  or  a  horse!

Unless  your  heart         has been regenerated  and you have the new  life  which         only  Christ  gives,  you  are  incapable  of  receiving  the         things that would form the right foundation for your life         and your future.         Unless you are born again by the Spirit of the Lord, you         are still natural and unspiritual. If the only birth you have         experienced  is  that  from  your  parents,  you  are  still         natural.         That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is         born  of  the  Spirit  is  spirit.  The  one  who  is  born  of  the         flesh,  born only once  by human parents  cannot  receive         the things of the Spirit. If that is your situation, you have         no capacity to receive the things of the Holy Spirit. They         will be folly or even meaningless nonsense to you.                  You are actually blind to spiritual things and your heart is         likened to the heart of stone. It cannot have the space to         receive  and  assimilate  things  that  are  heavenly.

You  must  confess         your sins to the Lord and turn away from them.

Marriage is a good thing              He  who  finds  a  wife  finds  a  good  thing,  And             obtains favor from the Lord.     Prov. 18:22             Houses  and  riches  are  an  inheritance  from             fathers, But a prudent wife is from the Lord.                                                 Prov. 19:14          Marriage  was  instituted  by  God.  Marriage  was  not          created by the devil. So when you think of marrying, you          are  not  doing  anything  evil.  When  thoughts  of  getting          married one day begins to come to a young lady, she is          not primarily going wrong. Marriage is good.           Neither  is  it  wrong  for  a  maturing  young  man  to  start          thinking  about  picking  a  wife.  God  Himself  created          marriage and places its desire in the hearts of both men          and women.          So  you do not have  to fight  the desire  to marry at this          age  of  choice.  Thinking  about  marriage does not  make          you worldly. That is not what makes one carnal. Marriage          was instituted even before carnality began. So, to marry          is not anything carnal.           You do not have to hide because you want to marry. You","Page 36               finding the          do  not  need  to  hide  your  thought  and  actions  about         getting a marriage partner.         Marriage is spiritual, it is godly and it comes from God.         Indeed, God Himself said, “It is not good for a man to be         alone”  without  a  wife.  Let  this settle  in  your  mind. God         who  created  marriage  made  it  a good thing right from         the  beginning.  Meanwhile,  marriage  was  created  ever         before sin entered the world.          Marriage  was  meant  to  bring  good  to  everyone         involved . . . to the man, the woman and to the society. It         was meant to bring help to the man in the work that God         gave him to do on earth (Gen.  2:18); and to bring him a         good reward for his labor (Eccl. 4:9).          Marriage was meant to bring fruitfulness to mankind and         to multiply people who are in the image and likeness of         God  on  the  face  of  the  earth  (Gen.  1:28).  It  was  God’s         plan to use marriage to keep the earth under control.          Whatever  happened  that  made  marriage  to  become  a         trouble in man’s flesh is a different thing entirely. It was         when man sinned that everything  turned down for him         and  his  marriage  was  also  affected.  That  was  when  the         glory of marriage was lost.         But  thanks  be  to  God  that  Jesus  came  to  seek  and  to         save  that  which  was  lost  (Lk.  19:10).  The  original  plan,         purpose  and  glory  of  God  for  marriage  has  been         restored through Christ and anyone who believes in Him         can experience it.","3 — what to know before the choice       Page 37           A help Fitting For your Life             And the LORD God said, It is not good that the             man  should  be  alone;  I  will  make  him  an  help             meet for him.                    Gen 2:18 KJV             Then the LORD God said, \"It is not good that the             man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit             for him.\"                        Gen 2:18 ESV          In  that scripture,  what God  called  the  woman is  a  help,          not a trouble. God did not say “I will make a trouble for          his life.”  In the beginning, God’s intention was that the          woman would be a help meet for him. In God’s mind He          is creating something in you as a woman which is going          to meet the need of a man; so that both of you can fulfil          the purpose of God on earth.          Let me also inform you that as a young woman, you were          not made to fit everybody or just anybody’s life, anyhow,          anywhere and anytime. And for you young man, it is not          every lady or even every Christian lady you meet on your          way  that  is  your  divine  size  or  that  is  God’s  choice  for          your life. God intends to make  a helper uniquely fitting          for your life.          Think  about  it!  Suppose  the  girl  you  are  running  after          now is an “undersize” or even an “oversize” for you, how          will she fit your life? Imagine you went to a shop to buy a          pair  of  shoes  and  you  were  mistakenly  given  size  41          when your size is 43, how do you go with it?           Even if you managed to squeeze your feet into them, you          will definitely not be comfortable at all. It will be so tight,          that  it  pinches  you  everywhere.  You  will  certainly  have          blisters walking with your undersized shoes.","Page 38               finding the                  This  is  because  man  looks  at  the  outward  appearance         but God looks at the heart. How can you run in life when         the shoe that would have been a help for you to run fast,         is  now  the  one  that  is  hurting  your  feet?  Whereas,  in         athletics,  you  may simply remove  the  shoe  so  as  to be         free  to  move  comfortably,  you  cannot  do  so  with  a         spouse. Marriage is for life. (Rom. 7:2).          So God said,            “It  is not  good  that  the  man  should  be  alone.  I            will make him a helper fit for him.”         A marriage partner given by the Lord is an expression of         His  favour.  You  can  inherit  material  things  from  your         parents  but  it  is  only  God  that  can  give  you  a  prudent         wife  and  a  faithful  husband.  You  need  to  trust  God  to         make a choice for you.         And God said . . .          Furthermore, in that scripture, it was God who spoke. It is         very  important  to  understand  this  before  thinking  of         making a choice. Before you start looking here and there,         you  need  to  first  hear  God  saying  to  you  that  it  is  not         good for you to be alone.","3 — what to know before the choice       Page 39           There  are some  people  who entered  into  courtship too          early. If  you get  married before it is  time for  you  as an          individual, your marriage will be confused because it will          be ill-timed and misplaced.           For any marriage to be correct, God has to initiate it. As          He said it for Adam, He will say it concerning each person          who  waits  for Him  and on Him. God has set a  time for          everything (Eccl. 3:1). You need to know what God’s time          for you to marry is.          Ever  before  you  begin  to  seek  a  marriage  partner,  you          must first sort out  whether God has said it is not good          for you to be alone or not.                 When  you  see  your  friends getting engaged  all  around          you, you may be tempted to start looking for someone          to hook by yourself. You may begin to work yourself into          a relationship that God has not seen in heaven and has          not  spoken  about.  So  peer  pressure  must  not  be  the          reason to start a relationship.          Sometimes such a wrong decision may also be triggered          by  a  wedding  invitation.  As  you  watch  the proceedings          something begins to ring in your head. You may begin to          say in your mind,               That will lead you into mistakes and a life of misery. Such","Page 40               finding the          an  occasion  should  not  be  the  reason  to  rush  into         making  a  marriage  choice.  God  must  say  it.  God  must         initiate it.         You  may  actually  not  know  that  the  person  you  see         around you now is a shadow; an ordinary mist that will         soon disappear. But because such are the ones that have         dominated  your  environment  as  of  now,  you  may  be         tempted to quickly choose a “mist”. A mist appears only         to  disappear.  If  you  start  a  relationship  with  such  a         person, it will not last; and it may lead you into trouble.

We         would  go  to  several  villages  to  preach;  and  we  most         times,  went  two  by  two.  Most  of  the  time  we  paired  a         brother  with  a  sister;  so  that  they  will  be  able  to  easily         preach to whichever of the gender they encountered.         As  it  sometimes  happens  with  young  people,  such         pairing  may  generate  peculiar  interest  and  some  have         come  back  dreaming  their  dreams  about  marriage,         simply  because  they  have  traveled,  trekking  several         kilometers together.         A  brother  came  back  one  day  to  give  me  a  four-page         foolscap (slightly bigger than A4 paper) writeup on why a         sister paired with him during the village outreach should         be the missing rib for his life.         I had suspected he  would  come  back  with that kind  of         story.  Thank  God,  he  was  rightly  guided.  Today,  he  is         married  to  the  right  woman  who  was  not  even  on  our         campus  as  at then.  It would have been  a great disaster         for him if he had gone on to marry wrongly.","3 — what to know before the choice       Page 41           On  one  occasion,  we  went  to  a  village  for  a  three-day          outreach.  As  we  were  about  to  leave,  a  wave  of          discussion arose among us brothers, to the tune that all          the  brothers  in  the  group  have  got  their  own  “bones”          within  our  group.  So  a  direct  question  was  focused  on          me being the leader then.                Innocent as that question was, I suddenly discovered that          I  was beginning  to  come under pressure  to  also pick  a          sister. Looking around I found one that seemed to fit all          my quiet expectations  and the  one I  thought  would be          the size for my life. It was like a joke but it mounted an          unusual pressure within me.          Something in me was saying,              A hasty spirit was taking over my soul and I was restless          for a few weeks. But just as I was going to take a step, I          prayed one day and the Lord said to me,                      That was how God delivered me.","Page 42               finding the                Many  years  later,  I  discovered  that  the  sister  I  was         thinking  of  picking  that  time  had  become  a  backslider.         She was very zealous at that time, having recently been         delivered from some demonic problems. She had a lot of         testimonies.         She  was  always  talking  and  sharing  testimonies  and         urging me to spend time in prayer with her for the village         outreaches. She looked like the right one to choose but it         would have been a disaster for me.         She went away from this Way we all cherished then. But         God saw ahead of me and plucked my feet from the pit         dug by the enemy to sink me and my destiny.                   Before I got to the university campus I had been involved         in Christian work here and there in my home town. I was         involved  in  a  Christian  drama  group  and  we  had  been         using drama as a platform for winning souls.          So, as soon as I got to the Christian Union meeting in the         university,  I  was  told  that  there  was  a  Drama  Group         among  them.  So  I  decided  to  join.  The  first  day  I         attended the drama subgroup meeting, I arrived to meet","3 — what to know before the choice       Page 43           the brothers and sisters rehearsing a play.          Just as I walked in, one of the ladies, a very good looking          sister, came and held my arms and said to the others,              My coming in, fitted her script and she decided to use it.          In  her  own  thinking,  she  was  only  acting  a  drama.  But          that thing troubled me for several months because after          the  rehearsal,  she  continued  to  joke  with  it.  From  then          on,  wherever  I  sat,  she  would  come  and  sit  with  me.          Sometimes she would complain that I did not even visit          her.          She did not know that it could be dangerous to joke with          such  a volatile issue.  Today I  can understand the  whole          issue  to  be  a  joke  and  an  ordinary  drama;  but  at  that          time it was quite a problem.                Do  not  let  your  heart  move  if  it  is  not  God  that  has          moved  in  it.  It  is  important  to take note of  this  so  that          you do not fall into a trap set by the enemy of your soul.","Page 44","finding the bone of your bones                            4 — I WILL MAKE . . .                The LORD God said, \"It is not good for the man             to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\"                                               Gen. 2:18 NIV            rom this passage, it is clear that it is God that makes.          F  He is the Maker. He made the man and He made the          woman. It is not a man that makes a woman for himself.          God makes a specific woman for a specific man.          Even  when  a  wife  dies,  God  still  goes  ahead  to  tailor-          make another woman specifically for that man. And if a          married man dies, God can still make another man, into          whose life the widow can fit.          It is God that makes; and up until today, He is still in the          business  of  making.  When  it  comes  to  the  issue  of          getting  a  marriage  partner,  wait  for  God  to  make  it          happen for you and to you.                    Only  God  has  the  dimensions  of  your  life  in  His  hands          and so when He makes a woman or a man for your life,          He makes with that dimension in mind. And God is not          only  making  the  dimension  that  you  can  use  in  the          present; He also knows your elastic limit. God determines          the  coefficient  of  your  elasticity,  He  knows  your","Page 46               finding the          expansibility.         When God is going to give you a wife, He will make her         with  the  knowledge  of  your  elastic  limit  at  heart.  He         already knows that you are able to expand to a particular         extent.  So  God  will  bring  you  a  woman  with  the  same         coefficient of elasticity; a woman who also has the same         capacity for expansion like yourself.         As you grow in your own life, she will also be growing; so         every  time, she  is  fitting.  If  she  fits  your  life’s need this         year, she will still fit your life in twenty years’ time. This is         because  just  as  twenty  years  have  brought  an  elastic         dimension to your life, it has also brought expansion to         her life.                So after some years when your life becomes bigger, she         still  remains  small  because  she  has  reached  her  own         elastic  limit.  And  because  she  has  no  more  capacity  to         expand, she will no longer fit. Because of this, it is wiser         to allow God make a spouse for you.         When you allow God to make a marriage partner for you,         He  takes  into  consideration  the  circumstances  of  your         growth,  all the  circumstances of the  challenges  you  will         face, and all the expansion that you will ever experience.         When God makes a woman for a man, He will put in her,         the potential for all that the man will need as he keeps         growing.  It  may  not  manifest  today  but  as  the  man         grows, he will soon discover that the potential God has","4 — I will make  . . .

This is the reason for you to let God make the choice of a          marriage partner for you. He will tailor-make her. He will          make her  the  kind  that  will grow  with  you  and  expand          with you. He will make for you someone who will always          fit  into  every  stage  of  your  growth  and  of  the          development  of  the  call  of  God  on  your  life  no  matter          what is happening.          I pray  that  the Lord  will  give you  understanding of this          and give you the courage to wait for Him to make him          for you as a lady and to fashion her for you as a man.

For  we  are  His  workmanship,  created  in  Christ             Jesus  for  good  works,  which  God  prepared             beforehand that we should walk in them.                                                  Eph. 2:10             And the Lord God said, \"It is not good that man             should  be  alone;  I  will  make  him  a  helper             comparable to him.\"                                                   Gen. 2:18           God  has  some  definite  work  that  He  wants  you  to          accomplish in your lifetime. There is something you were          born to be; there is also something that you were born          again  to  accomplish  in  the  family  of  God.  It  is  for  that          purpose  that  God  is  bringing  a  “help”  into  your  life  to          help you fulfil it.","Page 48               finding the          It  then  means  that  marriage  is  not  an  ordinary         relationship;  it  is  a  purposeful  relationship.  There  is         something God wants to achieve with your life as a man         and He needs a woman to stand with you to fulfil it. It is         not necessary to enter into such a relationship when you         do  not  know  where  you  are  going  in  life.  It  is  actually         dangerous to arbitrarily pick a wife when you do not yet         know what God’s purpose is for your life.         And as a lady, since God has called you to be a help fit         for  someone,  if  the  man  is  doing  nothing  for  the         kingdom of God in his life, what will become of you?  It         means  you  will  achieve  nothing  and  become  nothing         yourself  because  the  man  you  are  to  help  is  doing         nothing. What a waste of life that would be!                You  may  be  greatly  endowed  by  God  as  a  lady,  with         some wonderful gifts of the Spirit in your life. But those         graces  and  special  abilities  are  being  tailor-made  to  fit         into someone’s life, with whom you will be able to fulfil         the purpose of God. If you do not find that right person,         both you and your gifts may be jeopardized and wasted         eternally.         So  it  is not  enough to see a  man  that looks good; you         must  ask  him  and  God  about  what  he  is  meant  to         achieve in life for which you are supposed to help him.         You need to ask where he is going in life that God wants         you  to  join  him  before  you  say  “yes”  to  anybody  in         marriage.","4 — I will make  . . .

Then he             brought them to the man to see what he would             name  them;  and  that  is how  they  all  got  their             names.             So  the  man  named  all  the  birds  and  all  the             animals;  but  not  one  of  them  was  a  suitable             companion to help him.                                           Gen 2:19-20 GNB          This  Scripture  indicates  that  there  was  a  search  even          among the animals for a suitable helper for Adam after          God spoke about the need for a help fit for the man. The          conclusion  of  the  matter  was  that  none  of  them  was  a          suitable companion to help him among the animals. No          matter how useful certain animals are, or have become in          our time, none of them has the capacity to be a help, fit          for a man.             For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,             says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil,             to give you a future and a hope.

God  is  not  talking  about  giving  you  what  will         only  serve  for  the  moment.  The  present  is  not  as         important  as  the  future.  If  marriage  were  only  for  the         present, there would not have been any need to be very         careful about your choice. God plans to give you a future         and a hope.          God desires to see married couples still living and serving         Him together and the Lord’s glory breaking forth in their         lives after twenty, thirty, forty years. And even after then,         the couples still fit into each other’s lives happily raising         grandchildren after godliness.         How did God do it for the first man?             And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on            Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs,            and closed up the flesh in its place.            Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from            man  He  made  into  a  woman,  and  He  brought            her to the man.                                               Gen 2:21-22          And he slept         When God  said,  “I  will  make him  a help  meet  for him,”         what  He  did  to  the  man  was  to  immediately  cause  a         deep sleep to fall on him. And the man, Adam slept.          When you go in for a surgery, it is amazing that the first         thing they do, ever before the operation can start, is to         put  you  to  sleep.  You  will  be  given  anaesthesia.  This  is         done to enable you relax and give the surgeon complete         liberty to do the operation without your interference. The","5 — God at work . . . go and sleep!      Page 53           work becomes easier and faster when the person being          helped is put out of the way and not allowed to interfere.          In making a marital choice, the first thing to do is to enter          into a rest and give God the freedom to bring His best to          you when He has concluded His ‘making’.                 God must be given the liberty to work on your life and          for your life. Since it is God that will make the woman for          you  and  it  is  God  that  will  bring  that  man  to  you  as  a          woman, He needs liberty to work. You need to give God          the  liberty  to  do  His  work  and  make  a  choice  for  you          without your interference.          Imagine a doctor opening up the abdomen of a patient          that was not put to sleep. The first problem will be that of          pain.  The  patient  will  be  screaming  and  restless  with          every  slice  and  cut.  His  crying  and  struggling  will  not          allow the surgery take place.           Even  if  there  were  no  pain,  suppose  as  the  doctor          operates,  the  patient,  still  awake  and  observing  every          move of the surgeon, decides to contribute and says,               If  a  patient  keeps  doing  that,  will  the  surgery  yield  the          best  results?  Obviously  No!  Imagine  you  want  God  to          give you a wife but you are not sleeping. As you see God          going towards a particular lady you do not like, you will","Page 54               finding the          likely say,           Quietly,  you  will  use  some  wisdom  to  guide  the  Lord’s         hand in the direction that you prefer. That sort of thing         will certainly land you into a wrong choice.         The first thing God needs from you in order to give you         the  right  choice  in  marriage  is  a  total  surrender.  When         the Lord God caused the man to sleep, it was for Him to         have space in his life that allowed Him make and bring         the right woman. Thank God, he slept.         To sleep here does not mean to close your eyes . . . such         that it does not matter whoever you pick to marry. The         implications  of  this  life  of  surrender  at  this  point  when         you are convinced that God wants you to get married, is         to relax  and surrender  completely to God to guide you         according to His word and His will.          God worked on Adam first         God  first  worked  on  Adam  before  making  his  wife  for         him.  In  making  a  wife  for  you,  God  must  first  work  on         you before He can make a woman for you and bring her         into your life.             And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on            Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs,            and closed up the flesh in its place.             Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from            man  He  made  into  a  woman,  and  He  brought            her to the man.","5 — God at work . . . go and sleep!

When God put Adam to sleep, He did not start          running  around looking  for  a  wife  for  him outside  him.          What God did was to open him up, operate on him and          remove a rib from his bones.                 There  are  many  young  men  today  who  are  eager  to          propose marriage to ladies but there is yet no evidence          of a divine wounding or brokenness in their lives. There is          no  evidence of  any broken part of  their  lives for  which          they need help.          God works on the man first and brings him to a position          where he can see his weakness and his need for help in          his life.           I have not always seen the need for a woman. I used to          think  that  I  needed  to  be  a  celibate  for  Jesus.

It was only when God began to deal with my own life and          showed me my need for a wife that I began to pray for          God’s choice in marriage.

You  will  not  be         ready  for  marriage  until  God  has  dealt  with  you  inside;         until  He  has  worked  certain  things  into  your  character,         showing you the gap that needs to be filled in your life.                  I  counsel  you  as  a  young  man  to  concentrate  on  this.         Who knows? The  sister  God  intends  you  to  marry,  may         also still be in the making. God has not quite finished His         working upon her to the point of marriage yet.         But while God is working on the lady, if you quickly dash         into His workshop and demand to have her, even as an         unfinished product, you will be asking for trouble.          Allow  God  to  finish  His  work.    When  He  does,  He  will         bring her to you. While God is still working on her, she         will  not  be  ready  to  fit  into  your  life  and  carry  your         burden.          Meanwhile,  one  such  workshop  where  God  may  be         working  on  her  life,  may  be  under  her  Discipler  (her         spiritual guide). If you quickly pick her out and carry her         away before she is made, you would have carried away         an unfinished product that does not yet possess all the         inner capacities to enable her help your life effectively.","5 — God at work . . . go and sleep!      Page 57           Do not fret             Do  not  fret  because  of  evil  doers  or  about  the             wicked.  Don’t  be  envious  of  the  workers  of             iniquity; for they shall soon be cut down like the             grass and they will wither as the green herb.             Trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in the land             and feed on His faithfulness. Delight yourself also             in the Lord and He shall give you the desires of             your heart.             Commit  your  way  unto  the  Lord,  trust  also  in             Him and He shall bring it to pass. He shall bring             forth  your  righteousness  as  the  light  and  your             justice as the noon day.             Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him. Do             not fret because of him who prospers in his way;             because  of  the  man  who  brings  wicked  schemes             to pass.                                                   Ps 37:1-7           God  is  saying,  “Do  not  fret.”  Stop  fretting;  stop  being          anxious;  stop  being  worried.  You  cannot  make  a  good          choice of a marriage partner in anxiety. Stop looking here          and there. Sometimes, your heart may tell you that all the          ladies around you have already been picked for marriage;          so your heart is agitated and enters a rush to pick one for          yourself, as if you are competing with somebody.          For  example,  if  you  see  a  lady  you  have  been  thinking          about  for  marriage,  talking  with  another  young  man          excitedly, you may become agitated. You may quickly go          near  them  and  try  to  interrupt  their  discussion  to  gain          her attention. That only shows a heart that is fretting; it          shows you are not sleeping.","Page 58               finding the          And if you keep sending lovely and suggestive greeting         cards to a lady when God has not yet led you to her, it is         also an indication that you are fretting; you are anxious.         You are thinking that if you do not quickly register your         presence, another person may catch her.         Ladies also fret as they sometimes wonder whether God         has forgotten them. Something tells them quietly to go         out and show their face so that men may know they are         around.         Fretting makes you to make all kinds of arrangements to         show. These may include frying some chicken or buying         some cookies to send to a brother you think you will love         to marry. When you do such things you may likely end         up with a wrong person. Such human arrangements may         only cause you to miss out on the best pathway that God         has planned for your feet.         Do  not  be  hasty.  We  are  told  in  the  Bible  that  anyone         who  believes  in  the  Lord  shall  not  make  haste  (Isa.         28:16). Stop worrying. Do not let the presence of other         people make you feel that you will miss your chance.                If  you  have  to  compete  and  struggle  with  another  girl         over  a  brother,  you  will  live  the  rest  of  your  life  in         restlessness.  If  you  have  to  out-do  another  lady  in         dressing so that a man can turn his face towards you, you         will enter into a life of competition. The truth is that one         day, he will see someone else somewhere, better dressed","5 — God at work . . . go and sleep!      Page 59           and he will leave you to start running after her.          Furthermore, here are brothers that come bragging . . .                     You  must  not  be  intimidated  by  such  a  young  man;          neither  should  you  also  rejoice  for  having  that  kind  of          man.  He  is  not  a  godly  man.  He  is  a  proud,  unbroken          man.  If  you  cling  to  such  a  man,  you  will  forever  live          begging to please him.                  If a brother comes proposing to you and is not sure you          are God’s particular choice for him, but is trying to figure          who  to  choose  out  of  several  ladies,  do  not  take  him          serious; do not even pray about such an unsettled man.          Apart  from  not  fretting,  the  second  manifestation  of  a          “deep sleep” is to trust in the Lord. When you trust in the          Lord,  you  are  not  only  relaxed,  but  you  have  total          confidence in the ability of God to act.          Let me assure you, God is active; God is working. I know          how  God  worked  in  picking  my  wife  for  me.  He  is  still          working to pick for men today. He will do it for you too.","Page 60               finding the          And do good         While  you  are  trusting  in  the  Lord,  the  next  instruction         says, “. . . and do good.” There are these quiet but basic         instructions you need to consider before looking at how         to get the leading of the Holy Spirit in making a choice.         One problem with many young people is that once they         start thinking about marriage, that is the only thing they         will be thinking and working at. Even when such a young         man  goes  for  a  fellowship  meeting,  it  is  only  for  one         purpose: to catch a girl for marriage. He would no longer         see  or  hear  any  other  thing  happening  in  the  meeting.         He is only looking for a girl.         While in the meeting, should his book mistakenly fall and         a  lady,  out  of  her  kindness,  helps  him  to  pick  it  up,  he         says, “Oh God . . . and she picked up the book for me!”         He  may  then  lift  up  his  voice  and  begin  to  weep  like         Jacob did when he saw Rachael.          Knowing  the  will  of  God  is  deeper  than  such  flimsy         things.  If  you  allow  yourself  to  focus  on  such  flimsy         things, they will become very big in your eyes and block         your  vision  simply  because  you  are  pre-occupied  with         them.          While God is working in preparing a woman for you, you         should get occupied with God’s work, doing good. Keep         living  your  Christian  life;  keep  walking  with  God.  Keep         doing what God wants you to do.          Do  not  be  preoccupied  with  a  man  or  a  woman         otherwise you will fall into a trap. Do good, keep doing         what  is  correct.  Be  occupied  with  righteousness,  be         growing in character and in the virtues of Christ.","5 — God at work . . . go and sleep!

There are things to pursue; there          are kingdom attitudes to cultivate and grow in your life.          Pursue  righteousness,  faith,  love  and  peace  with  those          who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Those are things          to pursue, not a man or a woman.                  Do not tamper with your heart and life to destroy your          emotions. Do not occupy your mind with infatuation. Run          away  from  every  appearance  of  evil.  If  you  are          overwhelmed  with  infatuation,  you  will  find  yourself          wasting your thoughts and your time.                    Such  things  condition  the  mind  and  put  you  in  a          situation where you will not be able to know the will of          God. Your mind will become biased as that young man          becomes an idol in your heart.           Moreover, when you sleep, you are likely to dream about          a  person  whose  photograph  you  have  studied  very","Page 62               finding the          closely. You will likely see him in your dreams.         Then probably as you are going for lectures, one of those         evil coincidences planned by the devil will play itself out.         As you are entering the lecture hall from this door, he is         also  entering  from  that opposite door.  Then something         tells you that this is how you will march in and meet at         the altar one of these days.         You will of course, likely conclude that the Holy Spirit has         just  spoken  clearly  to  you.  Sister,  you  will  enter  into         trouble  that  way.  Such  things  will  hinder  you  from         knowing  the  will  of  God  because  your  mind  is  already         conditioned.         Occupy yourself with doing good. Occupy yourself with         the will of God for your life; be serving the Lord. You do         not need to dress particularly to draw attention.                   But this is not  to tell  you  to dress shabbily. You should         dress neatly; and dress simply. You do not even need any         make-up  to  be  beautiful.  Only  those  that  are  deficient         need  make-ups.  The  way  God  has  made  you  is  good         enough; there is an intrinsic beauty in you.         It is unfortunate that the devil and the world system do         not  allow  people  to  appreciate  the  uniqueness  that         oozes out of their lives as they grow. Do not let the issue         of your external appearance occupy your mind. Occupy","5 — God at work . . . go and sleep!      Page 63           yourself with the Lord and His service.          Delight yourself also in the Lord          To delight yourself in the Lord means to find pleasure in          the  Lord;  to  enjoy  yourself  in  the  Lord.  If  you  do  not          delight  yourself  in  the Lord  and  you occupy  your  mind          with thoughts  about marriage, you  are  likely to make  a          wrong choice.          For example, as a young lady, any day you begin to feel          as  if  you  are  not  attractive  and  that  is  why  no  man  is          coming  near  you  to  ask  your  hand  in  marriage,  your          focus  will  change.  If  you  entertain  that  thought  to  the          point that you no longer rejoice in the Lord for who you          are,  you  may  likely  fall  for  the  first  man  that  comes          around saying, “I love you.”          This is because something has conditioned your mind as          an  unlovable  person.  So  when  someone  says,  “I  love          you,” something will tingle in your heart, prompting you          to go with him. You will only become a cheap catch.          It is natural for the female gender to be sensitive to that          short  sentence,  “I  love  you.”  If  you  are  not  in  careful          control of your emotions, you will fall into wrong hands          before  you  realize  it.  And  that  may  just  be  that          something in your mind has already rated you less than          what God made you.                   Delight yourself in the Lord and rejoice in what God has","Page 64               finding the          made  you.  God’s  word  says  you  are  fearfully  and         wonderfully made and you are precious. It is because the         devil knows how precious you are, that he is chasing you         around.          I want you to remind yourself and keep saying it over . . .         “I am precious.” You are not an ordinary person. God is         doing  something  in  your  life.  Do  not  allow  any  wrong         thought about your appearance deceive you.          Delight yourself in the Lord. Be enraptured by His  love;         be overwhelmed with Him. The feeling of inferiority that         comes many times on girls makes them fall easy prey to         the first careless, empty lover that comes around. It is a         feeling, it is inside; and this feeling may never be openly         expressed.                   Find your pleasure in the Lord; set your affection on the         Lord, not first and foremost on a man or a woman. Enjoy         the Lord; be satisfied that Jesus is your Friend.         I had a friend while on the university campus. We used to         pray  together  a  lot.  But  we  ran  into  trouble  one  day.         There was this Christian sister, very nice and very spiritual         too, so we thought. She used to go for school visitation         with  my  friend,  taking Bible study  with students.  So  we         thought the sister was spiritual enough.          One day, my friend went to visit her at the female hall of","5 — God at work . . . go and sleep!      Page 65           residence.  She  was  sitting  on  her  bed  and  I  think  the          brother sat on the other edge of the bed, even though          there was a chair in the room. The sister noted that; she          noted it not only in her heart but also in her diary.           At another time, he visited her and met her eating. She          invited  him  to  eat  and since he  was hungry,  he  agreed          and  started  eating  from  the  same  plate  with  her.  She          again noted it, that the brother ate from the same plate          with her.          Then, her mother died; and the brother decided to write          her  a  letter  of  condolence.  To  begin  the  letter,  he  said          “Dear sister, in love and oneness with you at this kind of          time . . .” Then at the end of the letter, he wrote, “In love          and  oneness  with  you.”  Then  he  signed  and  put  his          name. She took the letter and filed it.           One day,  trouble erupted;  the sister  went  and reported          the brother to a senior Christian friend saying, “              When the brother was asked, he was shocked.            Then  she  quoted  these  three  incidences.  We  were  all          surprised. She was really offended.          Something in her heart had made her feel as if she might          not get anybody else to marry if she did not cling to this          one. She was somehow desperate to hold on to the only          one that had shown her some measure of affection. Her          desperation  made her  feel  as  if, the brother  must  have          been  thinking  of  marrying  her  for  him  to  write  such  a","Page 66               finding the          loving letter.                It  is dubious behaviour  for  a single Christian brother  to         keep  two  or  three  sisters  in  suspense,  on  the  issue  of         marriage. Such a brother has not made a clear marriage         proposal  but  he  is  tactically  occupying  a  space  in  their         lives as if there is something there. Let’s tell him, “Brother,         please go and sleep”.         Commit your ways to the Lord. Hand over the matter of         your marriage to the Lord and allow Him to handle it. Do         not be set in your own ways. Do not be wise in your own         eyes. Fear the Lord and run away from evil.          Do away with your idols         In order to discover the will of God in marriage, there are         certain things that you must let go of. You must do away         with your standards. These are the first set of idols.          For  example,  there  may  be  certain  things  you  are         dreaming about in the man or woman you would like to         marry, such as,              Those standards that you have set in your heart are the         idols of your heart.            Now some of the elders of Israel came to me and            sat before me. And the word of the Lord came to","5 — God at work . . . go and sleep!      Page 67              me, saying, \"Son of man, these men have set up             their  idols in  their  hearts,  and  put  before them             that which causes them to stumble into iniquity.             Should I let Myself be inquired of at all by them?             Therefore speak to them, and say to them, 'Thus             says  the  Lord  God:  \"Everyone  of  the  house  of             Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts             before  him  what  causes  him  to  stumble  into             iniquity,  and  then  comes  to  the  prophet,  I  the             Lord  will  answer  him  who  comes,  according  to             the multitude of his idols,             that  I  may  seize  the  house  of  Israel  by  their             heart, because they are all estranged from Me by             their idols.\" '             \"Therefore  say  to  the  house  of  Israel,  'Thus  says             the  Lord  God:  \"Repent,  turn  away  from  your             idols,  and  turn  your  faces  away  from  all  your             abominations.                                                Ezek. 14:1-6          Some  people’s  idol  is  their  tribe.  They say, “The man I          will marry must come from my tribe.”  For some others, it          is the height of the man or the lady. There are ladies who          say,                  That desire of your heart is not necessarily God’s desire          for you. God did not say He will give you the desires of          your heart anyhow. There is a premise to that promise. It          is if you delight yourself in the Lord that He will give you","Page 68               finding the          the desires of your heart.            Delight  yourself  also  in  the  Lord,  And  He  shall            give you the desires of your heart.                                                  Psa. 37:4         I pray that  God  will help you  to  completely  trust in  the         Lord and not to lean on your own understanding. These         are pre-requisites for God to lead you in making the right         choice. They are things that you must respond to, so that         the leading of the Holy Spirit can be very real, clear and         available to you.         If  there  are  standards  in  your  heart,  you  need  to  drop         them.  Those  standards  will  not  allow  God  to  show  you         the right person. I wish you can say to God,             God will do it and you will not regret it.          There  are  standards  that  quietly  settle  in  the  heart;         maybe from reading a book or seeing a photograph or         from what somebody said. Any of these may become a         standard  quietly  in  your  heart  to  which  you  have         consciously or unconsciously committed your heart.         Every  time the Lord  wants to bring someone  who does         not tally with those standards, you say, “No, I reject that         in the name of Jesus. I bind it.” That will bring you a delay         in marriage. You need to pray to God to uproot all such         standards, lest you fall into the trap of a wrong choice.         Profession  and  academic  qualification  must also not         be  an  idol in your heart. If a  Christian brother  who  is  a         teacher  comes  to  propose  marriage  to  you  and  before         you give an answer, another one who is a medical Doctor","5 — God at work . . . go and sleep!

Surely you are not going to get married to a profession          or qualification; you will get married to a man. Whatever          he is, he is a man. Allow God to choose the right person          for you.           Whatever  God  has  not  set  for  you  in  heaven  does  not          really matter in your development. Go and sleep; trust in          God. Do not set up standards and preferences before the          Lord; give Him a chance to lead you.                 Wait patiently for God to act             Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him; Do             not fret because of him who prospers in his way,             Because  of  the  man  who  brings  wicked  schemes             to pass.                                                    Ps. 37:7          Finally,  wait  patiently  for  God  to  act.  Stand  still  and  do          nothing on your own until God has spoken and worked          on you as a man or the lady. Stop scheming. God has a          plan for you, a good plan and He is going to bring it to          pass if you allow Him.           Surely the Lord will come to you at the right time; He will          not tarry. So wait on Him and for Him. He will lead you          and guide you into His choice. He will not come a minute          late. He makes all things beautiful in its time.","Page 70","finding the bone of your bones                             6 — DON’T MARRY                                        THIS ONE!              t  is  not  every  man  or  woman  you  see  that  you  can          I  marry.  Ever  before  you  start  praying  and  considering          any  person  for  marriage,  there  are  written  scriptural          conditions that God will have you consider.           Do Not Marry An Unbeliever          First on the list of those you should not consider at all for          marriage is an unbeliever.             Do  not  be  unequally  yoked  together  with             unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness             with lawlessness? And what communion has light             with darkness?              And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what             part has a believer with an unbeliever?             And what agreement has the temple of God with             idols? For  you  are  the  temple  of the  living  God.             As God has said: \"I will dwell in them And walk             among them. I will be their God, And they shall             be My people.\"             Therefore  \"Come  out  from among  them And  be             separate,  says  the  Lord.  Do  not  touch  what  is             unclean, And I will receive you.\"             \"I will be  a Father to  you, And  you  shall  be  My             sons and daughters, Says the Lord Almighty.\"                                               2Cor. 6:14-18","Page 72               finding the             Or  else,  if  indeed  you  do  go  back,  and  cling  to            the remnant of these nations--these that remain            among  you--and  make  marriages  with  them,            and  go  in  to  them  and  they  to  you,  know  for            certain  that  the  Lord  your  God  will  no  longer            drive out these nations from before you.            But  they  shall  be  snares  and  traps  to  you,  and            scourges  on  your  sides  and  thorns  in  your  eyes,            until  you  perish  from  this  good  land  which  the            Lord your God has given you.                                              Josh. 23:12-13         An unbeliever is not equal to a believer. It is an unequal         yoking for a believer to marry an unbeliever. Such a yoke         does not work. You will not make progress in life and in         your  marriage  if  you  go  into  an  unequal  yoking  in         marriage.          I know you would not like the man or woman you marry         to  become  a  thorn  in  your  flesh  .  .  .  a  trap  to  you,  a         scourge on your side and thorn in your eyes . . . until you         perish from the purpose of God.          Who is an unbeliever?         An unbeliever is someone who has not come to believe         that Jesus Christ died for him to save him and deliver him         from  his sins.  He  is  still living  in  sin.  Even  if he (or  she)         declares that he believes in Jesus and he is born again, if         there is no change in his life and he is still living in sin, he         is still an unbeliever!         The  issue  of  sin  is  the  distinguishing  factor  between  a         child  of  God  and  a  child  of  the  devil.  It  was  for  the         purpose  of  delivering  us  from  sin  and  Satan  that  Jesus","6 — don’t marry this one!                Page 73           Christ  came  and  died  on  the  cross.  Anyone  therefore,          who has not been saved (delivered) from his sins has not          yet  encountered  Christ;  he  is  not  saved;  he  is  an          unbeliever.             He  who  sins  is  of  the  devil,  for  the  devil  has             sinned  from  the  beginning. For  this purpose  the             Son  of  God  was  manifested,  that  He  might             destroy the works of the devil.             In  this  the  children  of  God  and  the  children  of             the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice             righteousness  is  not  of  God,  nor  is  he  who  does             not love his brother.                                                 1Jn. 3:8, 10          So, do not marry an unbeliever. Remember the story of          Samson.  His  consistent  interest  in  Philistine  unbeliever          women  ruined  his  great  ministry.  First,  was  a  failed          marriage  to  that  woman  at  Timnath.  Then  he  went          sleeping  with  a  harlot  in  Gaza.  The  final  straw  was  his          ungodly romance with Delilah, that led to the tragic loss          of his two eyes.          Delilah, who pretended to be “in love” with him was the          one who arranged for her Philistine people to pluck out          Samson’s two eyes. It was a terrible downfall of a great          man.          Before  then,  Samson’s  father  and  mother  had  warned          him  against  his  flavour  for  unbelieving  girls.  But  he          shouted them down saying, “Get her for me, for she suits          me  well.”  Even  though  God  was  going  to  use  it  as  an          occasion  to  deal  with  the  Philistines,  that  did  not          exonerate  Samson.  It  did  not  keep  him  from  being          punished for disobeying God and His word.","Page 74               finding the             So  he  went  up  and told  his  father  and mother,            saying,  \"I  have  seen  a  woman  in Timnah  of  the            daughters  of  the  Philistines;  now  therefore,  get            her for me as a wife.\"            Then his father and mother said to him, \"Is there            no  woman  among  the  daughters  of  your            brethren, or among all my people, that you must            go  and  get  a  wife  from  the  uncircumcised            Philistines?\" And Samson said to his father, \"Get            her for me, for she pleases me well.\"                                              Judges 14:2-3         Do not let unbelievers suit you well. The unbeliever that         is appearing to you as a suitor today will become a thorn         in  your  eyes  when  you  get  married  to  him.  When  the         Bible described how Delilah dealt with Samson, I felt like         crying. After  she  had  shaved off the seven  locks of  the         anointing on  Samson’s head  and  made  him naked,  the         Bible says “she began to afflict  (torment) him”.         There are many wives that have been the downfall of the         life  and  ministry  of  their  husbands  because  they  were         basically  unbelievers.  Many  unbelieving  husbands         likewise, have quenched the fire of the Holy Spirit in the         lives of their wives.         So,  do  not  be  unequally  yoked  together  with  an         unbeliever. He may dress well, he may speak well and he         may do many seemingly good things but he will end up         being a torment to your soul.          He  may  appear  kind.  An  unbeliever  may  come  around         when you lack school fees and give you the money you         need. He may buy you a Mobile Phone. Watch out! Do         not  get  yoked  with  him.  Your  destiny  is  at  stake.","6 — don’t marry this one!                Page 75           Determine in your heart not to collect such gifts whether          in cash or in kind, once it is from an unbeliever.          An unbelieving young man may say to you,                 If you collect it, you are entering into trouble. Young lady,          in  order  not  to  jeopardize  the  will  of  God  for  your  life,          you  must  not  make  yourself  a  public  property,  with          ‘access on demand’ to an unbeliever.          Many years ago, when there were no handsets; nobody          could send you a text. It was love notes that we used to          sneak into the hand bags of ladies in those days. But now          it is a different ball game; there is no need to sneak to do          anything again.          There is internet connection everywhere and some men          specialize  in  sending  SMS,  WhatsApp  chats,  photos,          Skypes and Tweets to young ladies. He makes it his daily          ministry  to  send  you  a  text.  He  would  sometimes          program it to get to you by 5.00 a.m. when you are just          waking up so that it is the first text you receive daily. And          as you open it, it reads,            He  is  simply  conditioning  your  heart  to  start  thinking          about  him.  Before  you  kneel  down  to  pray  early  in  the          morning, he has sent you that text. Just before you sleep,          he  sends  another  one.  So  he  dominates  your  thoughts          and before you know it, you cannot think straight again.          He  has  pushed  away  the  thoughts  of  God  from  your","Page 76               finding the          heart. You are already captured; you are gone.                Do not let an unbeliever use your being in need to catch         you  by  paying  your  school  fees.  Once  he  starts  doing         that, you will not have any ground to resist his marriage         proposal  or  even  his  attempts  to  sleep  with  you.  God         promises to supply all your needs according to His riches         in  glory  by  Christ  Jesus.  Trust  in  the  Lord  for  all  your         needs and He will not disappoint you.          My wife had serious financial challenges when she gave         her  life  to  Christ  at  the  university.  She  was  severely         persecuted by her father . . . to the point of refusing to         pay her school fees for three years. She was also given no         money for her personal upkeep. Yet, by the grace of God,         she stood her ground and trusted God to provide for all         the three years of persecution. And God did.         She  did  not  yield  to  the  temptation  to  misbehave  with         men because of her need. A little here and a little there,         God met those needs in His own way and her school fees         were paid as at when due. She was fed and clothed and         she never failed any of her courses in school. Trust in the         Lord  with  all  your  heart.  Do  not  make  any  man  your         support. God will prove Himself faithful even to you.         To know the will of God for marriage, unbelievers are out         of the question. An unbeliever may come to you with a         great  promise  that  he  will  repent.  He  may  say  actually         that he has been planning to repent, the only thing that         has  been  hindering  his  repentance  is  that  he  does  not","6 — don’t marry this one!                Page 77           have  anyone  to support him.  And he  tells  you  that  it  is          this issue of marriage that is really the problem.          He  may  even  tell  you  that  he  has  bought  a  bible  in          preparation  for  repentance  and  he  now  has  a  very  fat          bible.  As  you  try  to  preach  to  him,  he  may  even  kneel          down  there  to  repent  with  tears  in  your  presence.  If          infatuation,  aided  by  his  material  gifts,  has  not  blinded          your eyes, you should easily detect that this is all just to          catch you.                An  unbeliever  may  come  with  passion  to  whip  up  your          emotion in sympathy towards him or her. Do not agree to          marry an unbeliever because of sympathy. An unbeliever          is a child of the devil. If you marry him, the devil will be          your  father-in-law  and  one  of  these  days  he  will  surely          visit you even without your permission.          An unbeliever is a liar because Satan, his father is a liar. So          when he says he loves you and that there is no one else          like  you  in  his  life,  you  can  as  well  know  that  it  is  a  lie.          Think  about  it;  if  it  were  true,  would  he  need  to  keep          saying it? You are not a commodity for bargain. You are          not for sale; are you?                  Do  you  know  why  Ahab  became  a  wicked  man?  He","Page 78               finding the          married Jezebel, an unbeliever (1Kgs.  16:29-31;  21:25). His         wife pushed him and organized him to do evil.         She  arranged  for  him  to  take  over  Naboth’s  family         inheritance after he was stoned to death by the decision         of  a  kangaroo  court.  Do  not  think  you  can  marry  an         unbelieving  woman and  prevail  with  her.  Every unequal         yoking has the same potential danger.         As  a  lady,  once  you  marry  an  unbeliever,  he  becomes         your  head.  If  he  tells  you  not  to  go  to  church  or         fellowship  and  you  go,  you  are  disobedient.  Even  God         who  is  not  a  supporter  of  disobedience  will  send  you         back home saying,                  If  you  want  to  pay  your  tithe  and  your  unbelieving         husband says no, you are a woman under authority, your         tithe will be unacceptable to God. God does not accept         such. So, you can see that to go and bind your life with a         child of the devil is actually to waste all that God is doing         in your life.                 The  right  thing  to  do  in  obedience  to  God  is  to  break         that  relationship.  If  you  break  it  now  you  will  not  be  a         divorcee.  But  if  you  wait  until  he  goes  to  settle  your","6 — don’t marry this one!                Page 79           dowry and takes you to the altar, you will belong to him          until death do you part.          Are  you  contemplating  marrying  someone  who  is  one          leg in Christ and one leg outside? Stop it. You may think          that it is easier to convert a woman when she becomes          your wife, or convert a man after marriage. You will soon          discover that that is the greatest self-deception of all.          The moment you marry such a person, you are finished.          Since you have become one, he/she begins to see you as          same with him/her; so it will become more difficult to get          him/her  converted  if  he/she  is  not  already  converted          before marriage. He/she may actually convert you (Deut.          7:2-4; 1Kgs. 16:30-31).           A  pastor  can  preach  and  get  other  people  easily          converted,  but  not  his  wife.  Very  few  wives  are  able  to          learn  directly  from  their  husband’s  preaching.  A  wife          would easily learn from another pastor outside but when          it  is  her  husband  saying  the  same  thing,  she  may  be          laughing in the congregation.          This is because she knows her  husband  inside-out.  She          knows what others do not know about him by the reason          of their close relationship.               So  when  you  marry  an  unbeliever,  you  are  going  to          suffer. You cannot drive him or her out. She will actually          bring you down. Solomon was the wisest man that ever          lived. But it was women that brought him down.           He  went  into  unequal  yoking.  His  first  wife  was  from","Page 80               finding the          Egypt. And we are told in the Bible that he loved many         foreign  women.  As  he  grew  old,  they  turned  his  heart         from the Lord who had appeared to him two times.  o          Do Not Marry A Divorcee          The second person you should not consider for marriage         is a divorcee. A divorcee is different from a widow or a         widower.  God  may  lead  you  to  marry  a  widower  or  a         widow  in  His  will.  If  it  is  in  the  will  of  God,  there  is         nothing  wrong  about  that  because  death  has  already         parted him/her from his/her spouse.         Since  God  is  still  in  the  business  of  making  marriage         partners for people, He can still make that widow in such         a way that she will become suitable for another man. He         can still remake the widower as well.         But a divorcee is someone who has put away his wife or         her  husband  for  whatever  reason  while  the  wife  or  the         husband is still alive. Even if he is a pastor, once he is a         divorcee, God will not have you marry him no matter the         vision he sees for you. As long as the man’s wife is alive,         you will be an offender because you will be committing         adultery.            For  the  woman  who has a  husband  is bound  by            the law to her husband as long as he lives. But if            the husband dies, she is released from the law of            her husband.            So  then  if,  while  her  husband  lives,  she  marries            another man, she will be called an adulteress; but            if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so","6 — don’t marry this one!                Page 81              that she is no adulteress, though she has married             another man.                                                 Rom. 7:2-3             He  said  unto  them,  Moses  because  of  the             hardness of your hearts allowed you to put away             your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.             And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his             wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry             another, commits adultery: and whoever marries             her who is put away does commit adultery.                                            Matt. 19:8-9 KJV              \"I  hate  divorce,\"  says  the  LORD  God  of  Israel,             \"and  I  hate  a  man's  covering  himself  with             violence  as  well  as  with  his  garment,\"  says  the             LORD Almighty…                                               Mal. 2:16 NIV          So, you must not consider a divorcee at all in marriage. It          is not the will of God for you.          Now,  but  does  it  mean  that  divorcees  should  never          remarry? God’s word teaches us that if a divorcee wants          to marry, he or she should simply go and reconcile with          his or her spouse.              Now  to  the  married  I  command,  yet  not  I  but             the  Lord:  A  wife  is  not  to  depart  from  her             husband.              But  even  if  she  does  depart,  let  her  remain             unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And             a husband is not to divorce his wife.                                                1Cor. 7:10-11          If  any  divorcee  approaches  you  a  lady,  with  a  marriage          proposal, do not give him attention. Do not even let him","Page 82               finding the          keep  coming  to  visit  you,  else  you  will  soon  become         entangled with him.         You are an heir of God that God has a great vision for, in         your tomorrow. You do not need to stand with someone         who  is  not standing  with God.  Such  a  man  has  already         destroyed his own marriage. You are going far with God,         you do  not need to be  crippled  with  a strange  passion         for someone who is living in disobedience.          Do Not Marry A Backslider         The  third  person  that  you  should  not  marry  is  a         backslider.            The backslider in heart will be filled with his own            ways,  But  a  good  man  will  be  satisfied  from            above.                                                Prov. 14:14             When wisdom enters your heart, And knowledge            is pleasant  to  your  soul,  Discretion  will  preserve            you; Understanding will keep you,            To  deliver  you  from  the  way  of  evil,  From  the            man who speaks perverse things,            From those who leave the paths of uprightness To            walk in the ways of darkness;            Who  rejoice  in  doing  evil,  And  delight  in  the            perversity of the wicked;             Whose ways are crooked, And who are devious in            their paths;                                               Prov.2:10-15          You need to be aware that there are backsliders in heart,         who are however, still mingling with the congregation of","6 — don’t marry this one!                Page 83           the righteous; but there are ways of identifying them.          A  backslider,  the bible  says,  is  filled  with his own  ways.          And the way of a backslider is hard. He has left the paths          of  uprightness to  walk  in  the  ways of darkness. He has          become perverse. These are ways to know a backslider.          Those  that  have  turned  back  from  the  way  of          righteousness  may  still  have  the  language  of          righteousness.  He  may  still  know  all  the  scriptural          passages. So, you cannot accurately identify a backslider          by language or speech alone.           But when you meet a backslider, he is filled with his own          ways. He has become perverse, that  is, he  has deviated          from  the  original  way  of  life.  He  is  not  someone  you          should consider to marry.          Even  if  you  have  been  in  courtship  with  a  brother  for          long and two weeks to your wedding you discover he is          backsliden, you ought not to patch it up and go ahead.          You should immediately first suspend that wedding and          if confirmed, eventually terminate that relationship.           Instead  of  feeling  disappointed  or  jilted,  you  ought  to          actually begin  to  thank God  for  His  timely intervention.          Remember that if a backslider in heart hooks you, he can          only  take  you  backwards,  since  he  himself  is  sliding          backwards.          Something  to  note  about  backsliding  is  that  it  is          infectious.  It  is  easier  for  a  man  who  is  down  to  pull          someone else down, than for you who are standing up to          pull  him  up.  If  anybody  is  not  standing  well  in  the          presence  of  God,  he  is  not  someone  to  consider  for          marriage.","Page 84               finding the                  If he used to be a prayer warrior; but now you notice that         when you pray together he becomes very impatient after         just thirty minutes, something is  wrong somewhere. He         may be backsliding at heart already.         There are so called Christian brothers who look nice and         prayerful  in  fellowship  but  carnal  in  courtship.  If  you         enter courtship with such a brother, before long he may         start complaining about your praying too much, That is a         backslider in heart. Do not consider him for marriage lest         you fall irredeemably into a pit.          Do Not Marry A Recent Convert          Anyone who has been a child of God for some time, who         is currently standing in the testimony of the word of God         by  life  and  excitedly  following  Jesus,  is  a  person  to         consider for marriage.          He  or  she  must  be  established  in  the  faith,  and  not  a         novice.  Whereas,  a  person  does  not  need  to  be  an         ‘ancient  of  days’  before  you  can  consider  him  for         marriage,  yet,  he  or  she  must  not  just  have  repented         recently and is yet to know his bearings in the things of         God.         For example, someone who recently repented and within         a  few  weeks  makes  a  marriage  proposal  must  not  be         entertained. You must not say,","6 — don’t marry this one!                Page 85                No,  such  a  person  is  not  a  candidate  for  Christian          marriage just yet; he is a candidate for nurturing and for          spiritual growth. He is still a baby; he is yet unstable and          a novice as far as the Christian life is concerned.

Gen. 2:23-24          Marriage is for a man and a woman, not for a boy and a          girl.  Maturity  both  physically  and  spiritually,  is  a  crucial          requirement in Christian marriage. It is not correct to rush          a baby in Christ into marriage. You will only distract him/          her from focusing on his/her growth in Christ.                  You need to check if God has removed his rib and he is          of a broken and a contrite heart. Before God brought the          woman  to  Adam,  he  had  been  walking  with  God  for          some time and God had been dealing with him.","Page 86               finding the          If you will obey these instructions from God’s word and         allow God to work for you, you will not run into trouble.         Furthermore, marriage is for mature people and not for         boys  and  girls.  Do  not  consider  the  issue  of  marriage         when you are still a boy or a girl by age and behaviour.         You are still a boy if you still cry to your mother or father         when  there  is  any  little  problem.  Even  if  something  is         stirring within you to consider marrying at that stage, let         it stop. Refuse to be moved. This is because marriage is a         responsibility  and  it  takes  someone  who  is  a  man  or  a         woman in body and heart to shoulder such responsibility.          A man who wants to get married must be weaned from         parents  and  other  relations  so  that  he  can  be  free  to         handle family life and take care of family responsibilities.                 So do not rush into marriage. Prepare and be prepared         before you venture into it. I pray that the Lord will give         you understanding.","6 — don’t marry this one!

Trial and error will          not be right in this crucial choice of a lifetime. It is better          to  wait  and be sure than plunge in and  then ‘bite  your          fingers’ after.           There are many ways through which God makes His will          known  to  His  children.  We  shall  now  consider  some  of          these ways and means of knowing the will of God, even          in  choosing  a  marriage  partner,  praying  that  God  will          give you understanding.          The Written Word of God.           The written word of God (the Holy Scriptures) is a great          means of knowing God’s leading. It is probably the most          authentic  way  of  being  led  by  God  in  decision  making          especially  when  making  a  choice.  The  language  of  the          Holy Spirit is the written word of God.          So God speaks often through His word. Since the specific          name  of  a  brother  or  sister  may  not  be  written  in  the          Bible, you may wonder how God will speak through His          word to tell you the specific person to marry.          When  the  Holy  Spirit  uses  the  written  word  of  God  to          speak  to  you,  He  may  not  mention  the  person’s  name,          but He may bring the deep conviction of His will to bear","Page 90               finding the          on your heart as you meditate on a particular scripture.         We have several examples that allude to this.         Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  acted  in  Matthew  21:1-5  in         accordance with Zach.  9:9. That was the will of God for         Him at that time and He came to know it by the written         word of God. God can also make His will known to us the         same way. But that means you must let the word of God         dwell in you richly in all wisdom (Col. 3:16).         There  are  two  principal  ways  in  which  God  uses  the         Scriptures  to  make  His  will,  known.  God  may  use  the         Scriptures as an instrument to first of all deal with your         biases, your fears and your reluctance. Then He may now         use a scripture to lead you directly to His will.          For instance, He  may  not say, “Go and marry him.” But         God may lead you to a Bible passage that says, “Fear not.         I will not leave you or forsake you.”         Such  a  scripture  is  dealing  first  of  all,  with  your  fear;  it         may  not  yet  be  that  God  is  already  telling  you  to  go         ahead and marry him. Maybe the reason you are not able         to know whether God wants you to say yes or no to this         brother is because of a subtle fear.         You  could  be  afraid  of  the  far  distance  between  your         town and his. God  needed to deal first  with the  fear  of         being no longer close to your family before you can hear         Him.         So, that scripture is not necessarily telling you to say yes         to that brother; it is rather dealing with what is hindering         you  from  hearing  the  Holy  Spirit  about  the  matter.  So         when that scripture clears the ground, your spirit will be         released and will become open to receive the will of God.","7 — practical ways . . . of choosing     Page 91           As you pray further, He will then speak specifically. After          removing  your  fear,  you  may  expect  that  the  Lord  will          eventually tell you to marry that person; but actually He          may still say to you finally that the person is not His will          for you in marriage. Whatever the Lord says, you must be          ready to obey Him.           Sometimes  God  may  also  use  Scriptures  with  direct          interpretation  and  application to  convey  to  you  what is          the  mind  of  Christ  concerning  your  marriage.  Because          the word of God remains forever, it is the best anchor for          one’s convictions. Seek to get a word from God through          the Scriptures about it.             Because \"All flesh is as grass, And all the glory of             man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers,             And its flower falls away,             But the word of the Lord endures forever.\" Now             this  is  the  word  which  by  the  gospel  was             preached to you.                                               1Pet. 1:24-25           Before you say yes to anybody for marriage, make sure          you  do  not  base  your  decision  only  on  the  dreams  or          visions that you had even if you dream ten times about          the person. Let it be that despite all the dreams, you still          prayed and the Lord spoke to you from the written word.          Dreams may be forgotten and may pass away; they are          ordinary chaff (Jer.  23:28). But the word that God speaks          abides forever.          However, you may have a problem here if your mind has          not been renewed before by the word of God. You may          find yourself quoting Scriptures from your head in order          to support a matter that God has no hand in. But even if","Page 92               finding the          you do this, it would be evident. There shall be no peace         about it, as it is written,            There is no peace for the wicked, says my God.                                                  Isa 48:22         And,             ‘The work of righteousness will be peace, and the            effect  of  righteousness,  quietness  and  assurance            forever.’                                                  Isa.32:17         In addition, the interpretation of every scripture depends         on the purity of the heart of the person interpreting it. If         your heart is not pure, you will apply the Scriptures in an         impure manner.         That is why even in preaching, someone could twist any         Bible verse to say what they (not God) want to say; even         though, looking at its context, that is not the meaning of         that  scripture.    He  is  not  following  the  counsel  of  the         word  of  God;  he  is  only  speaking  according  to  the         impurity of his own heart.          So you must not be a novice in the knowledge of God         and  His  word.  As  you  grow  in  the  knowledge  of  God,         your mind will be renewed and sanctified by the word of         God  (Rom.  12:2;  Jn.  17:17).  You  will  then  be  able  to         interpret  and  discern  what  the  will  of  God  is,  when  He         speaks to you through the written word of God.         Through an “Inner witness”         (often called the still small voice)         When  God  was  going  to  speak  to  Samuel  for  the  first         time,  He  spoke  to  Him  through  a  voice,  the  still,  small","7 — practical ways . . . of choosing     Page 93           voice  three  times  before  Samuel  could  recognize  the          voice  of  God  through  Eli’s  guidance  (1Sam.  3:1-11).  The          Holy  Spirit  also  spoke  to  Philip  in  His  heart  to  instruct          him on what to do at a point (Acts 8:29-30).           Sometimes  God speaks  to us in  a voice  we hear  in our          heart though it may appear quite audible at times. When          He  speaks  this  way,  He  speaks  in  accordance  with  the          word of God. So you must be able to check if what that          voice says in your heart is according to the written word          of God.           Through Dreams, Visions, Trances, etc.          Dreams, visions and trances are common ways by which          people get  to know the  will of God. He  may choose  to          give you a dream or vision as you seek to know His will          even  about  the  choice  in  marriage.  But  you  must  be          careful  about  this  because  even  the  devil  uses  these          means to confuse God’s people.           When  you  have  such  an  experience,  you  must          immediately pray  and by  the  written  word of  God,  test          the spirit that brought that revelation to you so that you          will know whether it is from God or not.             Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the             spirits,  whether  they  are  of  God;  because  many             false prophets have gone out into the world.                                                     1Jn. 4:1          In  the  book of  Acts  chapter ten,  we  are  told  that Peter          had  a  vision  or  trance  one  afternoon.  But  as  he  was          thinking  about  the  trance  and  what  it  could  mean,  the          Holy Spirit came and spoke to him.","Page 94               finding the             While Peter  thought  about  the  vision,  the  Spirit            said to him, \"Behold, three men are seeking you.            Arise  therefore,  go  down  and  go  with  them,            doubting nothing; for I have sent them.\"                                               Acts 10:19-20         But  he  could  have  heard  that  without  falling  into  a         trance. The whole trance only prepared him to get to the         place of hearing the Holy Spirit. When you have a dream         or a vision or trance, if it comes from God, it must only         open you up to hear the Holy Spirit. It must not be held         onto, verbatim or in isolation.          There  are  some  people  whose  dreams  come  to  pass         exactly as they see it in the dream. There are also others         who  dream  but  it  is  exactly  the  opposite  of  what  they         saw in the dream that happens. Whatever the case may         be,  you  must  grow  beyond  that.  You  should  begin  to         pray that your dreams will open you up to directly hear         the voice of the Spirit of God as a child of God.          Suppose  a  Christian brother  comes proposing  marriage         to you and tells you a fantastic dream that he had, how         he  saw  you  and  him  walking  together  and  your  right         hand  suddenly  came  into  his  left  hand.  That  is  not         enough to base such a great decision as marriage upon.         Do not base your conviction only on a dream.            For a dream comes through much activity, and a            fool's voice is known by his many words.

In order to turn man from his deed, and conceal             pride from man, He keeps back his soul from the             Pit, And his life from perishing by the sword.                                                Job. 33:14-18           Dreams are conditional. There are many factors that can          cause a dream to come. So, before we accept a dream as          being a message from God, we have to check its source.          Not all dreams are from God. Dreams can come from any          of three sources. It can be from God; it can be from the          devil; but more worrisome is the fact that many dreams          come from the dreamer himself.           Even  though  God sometimes speaks  to  a  man  through          dreams,  it  may  come  through  much  thoughts  and          activities of the man who had the dream. Satan can also          give a man a dream. This is because dreams are given to          a man through the realm of his thoughts. Whoever and          whatever  therefore  fills  the  thoughts  of  the  man,  can          easily give him dreams.          Dreams  therefore,  must  not  be  treated  as  if  they  are          always  from God,  lest you  make  a terrible  mistake. You          still need to first find out if it is from God; and confirm it          with the written word of God.           A dream also has to be interpreted. They are not to be          taken  at  face  value.  They  are  usually  coded  messages          sent  to  a  man  because  of  his  peculiar  circumstances.          Therefore, a man is in the best place to interpret his own          dreams  because  he  alone  has  all  the  parameters  of          understanding and interpreting the dream.","Page 96               finding the          But if he is not spiritual, or he has idols in his heart, he         will likely interpret it to suit his selfish desires. Therefore         for  a  man  to  rely  on  his  dreams,  he  must  be  growing         spiritually and be passionate about doing the will of God.          And you must not take somebody else’s dream as your         reason for saying yes to his marriage proposal. God has         something to say to you about every case. You must be         careful to find it out. So you need to subject every dream         to  much  prayer  until  you  get  light  and  direction  from         God and His word.          Through Prophecy         God  can  also  make  His  will  known  through  prophecy.         However,  you  need  to  understand  that  the  prophetic         ministry  in  the  New  Testament  is  different  from  the         prophetic ministry in the Old Testament.         It  is  wrong  to  impose  prophecy  on  people  in  this  New         Testament  times,  as  it  used  to  happen  in  the  Old         Testament. We are also not expected to be going to the         Prophets for personal guidance as was the practice in the         old Testament.                Therefore, those who wanted to find out what God says         about any issue had to go to the prophet to enquire of         the  Lord.  Then  the  man  of  God  would  go  in,  pray  and         come out to say, “Thus says the Lord…”          So,  they  were basically  the only people  that  could hear","7 — practical ways . . . of choosing     Page 97           God  or  see  into  the  spirit  realm.  Prophets  had  that          monopoly in the Old Testament but not in the new.           But concerning the New Testament, God said,             \"And it shall come to pass afterward That I will             pour  out  My  Spirit  on  all  flesh;  Your  sons  and             your  daughters  shall  prophesy,  Your  old  men             shall  dream  dreams,  Your  young  men  shall  see             visions.             And  also  on  My  menservants  and  on  My             maidservants  I  will  pour  out  My  Spirit  in  those             days.                                                Joel 2:28-29          That  already  shows  that  the  prophetic  ministry  has          changed  from  that  of  a  monopolist,  in  which  someone          brings  a  word  from  God  which  every  other  person  is          ignorant about. The New Testament says about prophecy          in the church,              “Let  two  or  three  prophets  speak,  and  let  the             others judge.”                                                  1Cor 14:29          This is because in the New Testament, each one of us has          the Holy Spirit and from Him, we can confirm or disprove          what a person is prophesying.                 Suppose you go for fellowship and during the meeting,          someone begins to prophesy, . . .","Page 98               finding the                Even if such a prophecy comes with a voice of thunder as         if  it  was  coming  straight  from  heaven,  a  child  of  God         should  not  be  intimidated  by  that.  You  still  have  every         right to test and judge it, as we are instructed of God to         do.            Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the            spirits,  whether  they  are  of  God;  because  many            false prophets have gone out into the world.                                                    1Jn. 4:1           Secondly, you should not base your action and decision         simply on a prophecy because prophecy passes through         the mind of the person prophesying and the mind may         affect it.                      Whenever  a  prophecy  comes  from  God,  it  should  find         confirmation  in  other  people’s  spirit.  Others  should  be         able to judge it and check its source. If it does not find         confirmation, it should be discarded.          Sad to say, you must also be careful of some pastorally-         arranged  prophecies  and  word  of  knowledge ,  in","7 — practical ways . . . of choosing     Page 99           choosing a marriage partner.          Sometimes,  the  pastor  has  been  speaking  with  a          Christian brother about making a choice in marriage and          he says to the brother,          Now as soon as you come to the church prayer meeting,          the man of God says,                 So, because you are anxious about getting married, when          the  brother  finally  comes  at  7.00am  the  following  day,          you  are  excited.  You  do  not  know  that  it  is  an          arrangement.          Do not allow yourself to be manipulated especially when          it comes to the marriage choice. External prophecy must          not be the only thing that you depend upon to make a          choice.                    Even if that person who prophesied to you is your friend,          pastor or discipler, none of them  is God,  your heavenly          Father.  You  must pray  and find  out  if it is  from  God.  If          you are a child of God, you are His sheep; and His sheep          hear  His  voice.  He  will  speak  to  you  in  a  way  you  will          understand.","Page 100               finding the          In the book of Acts 13, God said . . .            As they  ministered  to  the  Lord  and  fasted,  the            Holy  Spirit  said,  \"Now  separate  to Me Barnabas            and  Saul  for  the  work  to  which  I  have  called            them.\"                                                  Acts 13:2         God  had  spoken  to  Barnabas  and  Saul  privately  before         about  the  work.  The prophecy  that  came in  their  midst         on that day was just a confirmation of what God had told         them before.         Do not let anybody manipulate you with his prophecy. Be         careful to  test every spirit  to  know  whether  they  are  of         God.  All  those  prophets  will  not  be  with  you  in  your         marriage to go through whatever you face there. All they         can do  is attend your wedding. After your wedding, you         will  be  left  alone  to  face  your  choice,  alone  with  the         person you have chosen to marry.

Ps 32:8-9         God  may use circumstances  to  confirm  His will  to  you.         When God was going to lead Samuel to choose the first         king for Israel, He spoke to him the previous day that He         would bring him a man the following day from the land         of  Benjamin  who  would  be  the  king  over  His  people         (1Sam. 9:15-16).","7 — practical ways . . . of choosing    Page 101           Then  God  made  him  to  meet  Saul,  the  son  of  Kish,  a          Benjamite the following day as Saul and his servant were          looking  for  his  father’s  lost  asses.  God  used  that          circumstance  to  confirm  what  He  told  Samuel  the          previous  day  and  Samuel  was  convinced  that  Saul  was          the man God told him about.          God  may  describe  to  you  the  features  of  the  man  or          woman you will marry or the place where he comes from          ever before you meet him or her. He may even give you          a scripture ahead of time to describe such. So, He goes          ahead to arrange your paths to cross each other. As soon          as you meet, something strikes in your heart that this is          the  person  because  the  circumstances  tally  with  what          God has said to you before.                 Sometimes,  God  also uses other  circumstances like bits          and bridle . . . hard and terrible experiences . . . if you are          not sensitive to spiritual things. For instance, if someone          enters into a courtship that God is not in, they may have          gone for two or three years together, before something          drastic now happens.          The young man just wakes up one day and writes her a          letter that because of something wrong that she did, he          is no longer interested. Though that will be quite painful,          it may just be God having mercy on you because of the          danger He has seen ahead.          God  most  probably  had  tried  to  speak  directly  to  you          before, but you had fallen so much in love that you could","Page 102               finding the          not hear. Having found no other means of helping you,         God had no choice but to block your way.         Sometimes  God  uses  different  kinds  of  difficulties  to         direct  one’s  life.  Jacob  was  such  a  man  who  passed         through  a  lot  of  difficulties  in  life  because  he  lacked         understanding.          God had met with him from the top of the ladder which         he  saw  in  his  dream  in  the  book  of  Genesis  chapter         twenty-eight  with  a  lot  of  promises.  But  being  a  self-         willed man, he did not allow God take the preeminence         in his choices.         When he got to the house of Laban to get a wife, he did         not pray to seek God’s direction about who to marry. He         simply made His choice by himself.         So God, wanting to help Jacob, allowed his arrangement         to  be  changed.  They  brought  Leah  to  him  instead  of         Rachael. God was using that to help Jacob enter His will;         but  because  he  was  a  very  ‘strong’  man,  he  still  went         forward to pay another dowry of seven years of rigorous         labour to marry Rachael.                 The Levites were the priests in Israel; Judah provided the         King,  David  and  the  Lord  Jesus.  What  did  Benjamin         produce except Saul of Kish? Joseph was a good man on         account of his own personal walk with God; but nothing         much came from his lineage.","7 — practical ways . . . of choosing    Page 103           And  by  the  time  Jacob  was  returning  home  with  his          wives,  children  and  possessions,  God  had  to  send  an          angel  to  wrestle  with  him.  The  angel  eventually  had  to          remove  Jacob’s  thigh  out  of  joint  before  he  could          humble himself to let God help him.                     Imagine you started thinking of marriage five years ago.          But in the purpose of God, no matter what you do, you          are not  going to get  married until  after  another five  or          even seven years! You would have merely been wasting          your  time  and  emotions  for  many  years  instead  of          concentrating  on  God  and  some  other  things  He  had          been  wishing  to  lead  you  into.  That  will  be  a  hard          experience indeed.          There was a sister who was posted to the town where I          lived  in  1981,  for  her  National  Youth  Service  Corps          program,  (a  compulsory  one-year  national  service          program for fresh Nigerian graduates). She felt that she          should get married that year; but when I prayed the Lord          said to me,               I  was  afraid  to  tell  her  this.  I  felt  she  would  not          understand.  So  I  told  her  to  just  relax  and  serve  God.","Page 104               finding the          People  around  her  were  fasting  and  praying  for  her  to         get married; but I said to her “it is not yet time and when         the appointed time comes, it will happen easily”.         And  so  it  happened.  Seven  years  later,  the  right  man         came to propose to her and not too long after, they got         married.          But  suppose  within  the  waiting  period,  because  she         could  not  wait  and  trust  God,  someone  came  around         proposing marriage to her. And for lack of patience, she         insisted that it was the will of God and accepted to marry         him.         But he would not have been the will of God for her; and         her time to marry had not yet come.  Supposing he had         even  gone to the  extent of going to know her parents,         how would God had prevailed with His will over her?          Most  likely,  after  settling  together  in  to  courtship  for  a         while,  a  misunderstanding  then  might  have  happened         suddenly;  the  relationship  scatters  and  she  would  have         been back single. And all this would simply be because it         was not yet time.         If  God  loves  a  person,  He  may  use  such  painful         circumstances  to  guide  him  on  the  right  path  to  avoid         future calamity.

It should also come to you as a confirmation. You          must seek God and allow Him to speak to you personally          about it.          In fact, the best role of these godly people is in guiding          you to seek God for yourself; helping you to find His will          and  after  knowing  it,  to  show  you  the  best  way  to  go          about it.                 This  is  because  they  have  been  taking  oversight  over          your  life  and  God  will  not  keep  them  in  the  dark  as          regards whether this way you are going is right or wrong.           You must not fall into the common error of some young          people  and  disciples  who  suddenly  cannot  trust  their          parents  or  guardians  when  they  reach  the  junction  of          marriage. If they could get for you and confirm the will of          God for your choice of school, your choice of career, etc.          God should be able to help them to help you even at the          junction of marriage.","Page 106","finding the bone of your bones                               8 — MAKING THE                        MARRIAGE PROPOSAL              n  the  European  culture,  when  a  young  man  has  seen          I  the  young  lady  he  desires  to  marry,  he  will  seek  her          permission to “take  her  out”,  maybe to a restaurant or          any  other  place  of  interest  where  they  could  start          relating.  This  dating  is  without  any  commitments  or          responsibilities. It is just a mutually agreed time to check          one another out.           After  some  time  of  doing  this,  he  then  makes  his          marriage proposal to her, if he is satisfied with what he          sees to be qualities of a good wife. If she also falls in love          with  him  and  agrees  to  marry  him,  they  then  begin  to          make  wedding  arrangements.  That  is  what  they  call,          dating.          In many other cultures however, especially in Africa, it is          not  so  done.  Because  of  our  extended  family  system,          both  families  are  involved  quite  early,  sometimes  even          long before the proposal is made.                  For us as God’s people, the first thing to do is to find out          the will of the Lord, about your choice. Our arrangement          for  finding  and  proposing  marriage  is  neither  through          dating, nor through the arrangement of the family.","Page 108               finding the             As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are            the sons of God.                                                  Rom. 8:1         You may  also need  to seek confirmation from  elders in         the Lord, who will help you check properly if that person         is  born  again.  They  will  check  other  parameters  of  his         character  and  also  pray  to  see  if  he  or  she  is  God’s         particular  will  for  you  in  marriage.  This  is  necessary  to         fulfil the scriptural demand that “out of the mouth of two         or three witnesses, every truth shall be established”.          It is not that you should not seek to know and be familiar         with  the  person  you  want  to  marry  at  all.  Whether  you         have been together in the same Christian group or not, it         is still important for you and other elders to find out who         he/she really is.         This forms an integral part of what will enable you to be         sure of what the will of God really is. It is not just a matter         of saying, “Thus says the Lord.”                  The  process  or  procedure  of  making  your  proposal         depends on the communal practices of both families, as         well  as  the  church.  The  important  thing  is  that  you         communicate  what  God  is  laying  in  your  heart  to  the         person concerned very clearly.          A marriage proposal should be definite enough to show         an  unconditional  life  commitment  to  one  another.  It         should  be  so  clear  that  it  can  actually  be  documented.","8 — making the proposal                 Page 109           The day the two of you say yes to each other should be          documented in the presence of God, both in your hearts          and even physically on paper, in your diary, if possible.           Things to Note About A Proposal             You need to understand that your conviction as a man          1  alone  is not  the necessary  and  sufficient  condition  to          conclude the possibility of marrying a lady.                 So  when  you  make  a  marriage  proposal  to  a  sister,  do          not think that your courtship has started until she gets a          word  from  the  Lord,  has  become  convinced  and  has          come to say so to you.          After making your intention known to a lady, make sure          that while she is still praying and she is not yet sure, you          do not go about introducing her to people as the person          you are going to marry.           That  may  cause  a  lot  of  embarrassment  for  her  and  it          may  eventually  not  be  to  your  advantage.  Wait  quietly          for God to convince her.            If  in  your  church  or  fellowship,  the  arrangement  of          2  making  the  proposal  and  giving  a  response  to  a          proposal  has  to  be  done  by  your  church  leader  or          marriage committee or something like that, it will be best          to follow their instructions.              Do not make a marriage proposal with gifts. Gifts          3  bias  and  blind  the  mind.  Do  not  bribe  a  lady  into","Page 110               finding the          marriage,  lest  another  person  comes  after  you  are         married with a higher gift and she goes with that man.         And  as  a  lady,  do  not  get  bribed  into  marriage.  Do         not let a man bribe you into marriage with a cell phone, a         ring or special body cream or even money. You are worth         more  than  that.  You  are  priceless,  so  precious  to  God         that it took the death of His Son on the cross to redeem         you. Do not give yourself away so cheaply.         When a lady has not yet said “Yes” to your proposal, do         not  keep  going  to  her  family  members  with  gifts.  That         will  amount  to bribing  your  way  through. It  means  you         are  stampeding  her.  All  such  will  create  a  weakness  in         your relationship in the future.             When  a  response  to  your  proposal  is  still  pending,         4  your mouth must be shut.  Do not weary her with your         visits,  calls  or  text  messages.  The  relationship  has  not         started yet. You must not presume her acceptance.                  She must be given the liberty to say, “I  prayed  through         and God told me this and that.”  Allow her to have her         own  personal  solid  foundation  for  the  relationship  so         that no matter what happens in the future, she would be         able to stand with you and go through without falling.           Proposals must not start with frivolous and infatuating         5 expressions like kissing or romancing. That was Jacob’s         way and his marriage was not a good example to follow.","8 — making the proposal                 Page 111           Your  proposal  is  one  of  the  strongest  foundations  of          your relationship.             The  way  you  become  convinced  is  a  story  that  you          6  will always tell in your life-long relationship with each          other.  You  should  tell  each  other  that  story,  especially          after  the  sister  has  also  independently  confirmed  her          conviction.  It  is  a  very  important  anchor  for  your          relationship.           But  if  at  that  point,  you  are  only  acting  on  ordinary          infatuation  and  intoxication,  when  you  will  need  that          story,  there  will  be  nothing  to  say  in  terms  of          righteousness.  Each  time  you  meet  couples  whose          marriage lasted, you will discover that their story always          begins at their time of conviction. It is a very important          and  critical  point.  Do  not  mishandle  or  corrupt  your          marriage foundation.             As a lady, when a man makes a marriage proposal to          7  you, it is your duty and responsibility to pray and get          your  own  confirmation.  Nobody  must  rush  you  into  it;          you must respond as God speaks to you.          However, you should  also not keep the  man in endless          suspense. Do not say you are still watching and praying          for the next two or three years. If your heart is pure and          clear,  you  should  be  able  to  hear  God  without  much          stress and get your confirmations as soon as possible.","Page 112               finding the          Whereas  your  conviction should  also  be subjected  to  a         test of time to prove whether it is from the Lord or not, it         must not be delayed endlessly when God has spoken.         If  God  has  not  spoken  to  you  clearly,  you  should         truthfully  tell  him  what  is  happening,  and  give  him  an         assurance that  when  you get  an  answer from  the Lord,         you  will  let  him  know.  But  do  not  keep  him  waiting         endlessly.          And when you have not said “Yes” to a man’s marriage         proposal,  you  should  not  also  expect  him  to  keep         coming around you or showing undue affection. It is not         his  affection  that  is  first;  it  is  your  own  personal         conviction.          Who should make the marriage proposal;         the man or the lady?             You  did  not  choose  Me,  but  I  chose  you  and            appointed you that you should go and bear fruit,            and that your fruit should remain, that whatever            you ask the Father in My name He may give you.                                                   Jn. 15:16         Marriage here on earth is an illustration of the marriage         between Christ and the Church. The Lord Jesus Christ is         the  Bridegroom  and  the  Church,  His  Bride.  He  is  the         pattern Son and we are to follow in His footsteps.          In  His  relationship  with  His  Bride  as  we  see  in  the         Scriptures  afore  quoted,  Jesus  was  the  One  who  made         the proposal. He chose us; and as we agreed with Him,         our relationship with Him began.         So, if we really want to follow Jesus and walk in His steps,","8 — making the proposal                 Page 113           it  is  the  man’s  responsibility  to  make  the  marriage          proposal;  and  not  the  lady’s.  That  is  the  consistent          pattern we find in the Bible.          Another scripture says,              “He  who  finds  a  wife  finds  a  good  thing,  and             obtains favor from the Lord.”                                                Prov. 18:22.           It did not say “She who finds a husband . . .”  So please          wait for the man to come. Even if God has spoken to you          beyond  every  reasonable  doubt,  wait.  If  God  is  in  the          matter, He will speak to him and cause him to come to          you.          There is more to knowing the will of God than “Thus says          the Lord.”  There is  also  God’s  timing  attached  to  God’s          will. And you must be able to prove it in a godly way. You          must be able to prove what is that good, acceptable and          perfect will of God (Rom. 12:2).                  If  you  are  the  one  who  goes  to  make  the  proposal,          tomorrow he may say to you,               So wait for the man to make the proposal to you. Walk in          the steps of Jesus.","Page 114","finding the bone of your bones                                 9 — TIPS ABOUT                                      COURTSHIP               here  are  few  things  that  courtship  should  help  you          T  accomplish.  It  is  meant  to  prepare  you  not  only  for          your  wedding  but  also  for  the  marriage  relationship.          Courtship is godly and Biblical.                    The  courtship between Joseph  and Mary,  the  mother  of          Jesus is a ready example in the Bible. They were both in          courtship and she was still a virgin. The fact that a sister          says “Yes” to your marriage proposal is not a license for          you to defile her with sexual immorality. Courtship is not          the same thing as marriage. Until you are married you are          not married.                    Courtship  is  a time of understanding  and understudying          one another. It is also a time to seek parental release. It is          a period of praying and learning from the Lord and from","Page 116               finding the          His  word together,  and  learning  what His  plan  for  your         future relationship in marriage is.         It  is  a  period  of  amalgamating  your  different  mind-set         and personalities, in the presence of God. It is a period of         preparing for the life-long journey together in marriage.                     So  instead  of  letting  the  young  man  pat  you  on  the         cheek and tingle you and kiss you, you should frown at         this and insist that he wait until after your wedding.         If the man’s first attraction to you is to touch and caress         your  physical  body,  that  marriage  may  not  last.  It  is         because  what he started  with is  temporary, not  eternal.         Physical beauty may disappear with time.             Favour is deceitful, beauty is vain; but a woman            or a man that fears the Lord shall be praised.                                                Prov. 31:30          If you start kissing one another in courtship and the man         saw how cheaply you fell into his hands, it goes into his         subconscious. Something within him keeps saying . . .                Or it may be her that will keep suspecting him anytime","9 — Tips about Courtship                Page 117           she  sees  him  standing  alone  talking  to  a  lady.  That          suspicion  remains  even  after  people  are  married  for          many  years  and  it  becomes  the  beginning  of  their          problems.           So keep yourself pure. Lustful looks and pre-marital sex          are  not  only  sinful  they  will  also  damage  your  trust  in          each other.          The period of courtship should be used in such a way as          to help you jointly participate in what will be the focus of          your service together for the Lord in the future.           When you are in courtship, you should both be involved          in what you know God is leading you to do as a service          to Him in the future together. Your courtship should help          you to harmonize what you both believe. So the period          of courtship is very crucial. Do not overlook or waste it.           Is it time?           Finally, one crucial question to ask in making a choice of          a  marriage  partner  is,  “Is  it  time?”  Somebody  who          entered the University for a five-year Course should not          be thinking of getting a marriage partner in the first few          years on campus.          What are you going to be doing with a man or woman          around you for five years? It is a distraction. You will be          creating  a  trap  for  yourself.  He/she  will  dominate  your          life and your  thoughts so much  that you  will no longer          be concentrated or resourceful in your course.          There is time for everything. When the time comes, the          Lord will speak about it.","Page 118               finding the          Do not go and start a relationship because everybody is         doing so. And do not love a man so much as to sacrifice         your academics and your future for him.              Any man who does not respect your body as to preserve         it  until  after  your  wedding  is  not  a  good  man.  And  his         love is not the true, godly love. You may think he loves         you but the truth is that he actually hates you. He is an         exploiter.              And  if  you  cripple  a  lady  with  infatuation  and  sexual         immorality so that she becomes a drop out, you will also         eventually become crippled.  If in life you have to carry a         crippled wife along, you also will not go far.         And  whoever  defiles  the  temple  of  God,  him  shall  God         destroy,  for  the  temple  of  God  is  that  sister  or  that         brother. Do not try it. Fear God.         You must determine that even in your courtship, you are         going to honour the Lord. You must insist that you will         be a young lady or a young man of integrity. If you learn         to  be  self-controlled  during  your  courtship  it  will  make         you a man of dignity.         It  makes  you  a  man  of  your  word.  It  means  that  when         you say no, you can stand by your word. Integrity is built         by  little  actions  where  you  stand  by  your  word  and  by         your commitments.","9 — Tips about Courtship                Page 119                Daniel determined and said, “I will not defile myself . . . ”          and he stood his ground. As terrible as Sodom was, there          were two girls there who retained their virginity. You can          also take your stand for purity, dignity and righteousness.","Page 120               finding the","",""];
